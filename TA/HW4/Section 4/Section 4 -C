Exercise 4-1
The nth triangular number is given by n * (n + 1) / 2. Create a sequence of the
first 20 triangular numbers. R has a built-in constant, letters, that contains the
lowercase letters of the Roman alphabet. Name the elements of the vector that you
just created with the first 20 letters of the alphabet. Select the triangular numbers
where the name is a vowel. [10]

	>triangle =  choose(seq(20),2)
	> names(triangle) = letters[1:20]

	> names[c('a','e','i','o')]
	> triangle[c('a','e','i','o')]
	  a   e   i   o 
	  0  10  36 105 


Exercise 4-2
The diag function has several uses, one of which is to take a vector as its input and
create a square matrix with that vector on the diagonal. Create a 21-by-21 matrix
with the sequence 10 to 0 to 11 (i.e., 11, 10, … , 1, 0, 1, …, 11). [5]

	> d= c(seq.int(11,0),seq.int(1,11))
	> b = diag(d,21,21)

Exercise 4-3
By passing two extra arguments to diag, you can specify the dimensions of the
output. Create a 20-by-21 matrix with ones on the main diagonal. Now add a row
of zeros above this to create a 21-by-21 square matrix, where the ones are offset a
row below the main diagonal.
	> x= diag(1,20,21)
	> r = integer(21)
	> t = rbind(r,x)
	> View(t)



Create another matrix with the ones offset one up from the diagonal.
Add these two matrices together, then add the answer from Exercise 4-2. The re‐
sultant matrix is called a Wilkinson matrix.

	> x= diag(1,20,21)
	> r = integer(21)
	> t = rbind(r,x)
	> x1 = x
	> Wilkinson = x+x1+b     # b is coming from exersise 4-2



The eigen function calculates eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix. Calculate
the eigenvalues for your Wilkinson matrix. What do you notice about them? [20]
	The eigen value is the same as the main diagonal of b matrix

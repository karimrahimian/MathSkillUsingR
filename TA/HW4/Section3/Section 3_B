Exercise 3-2
Randomly generate 1,000 pets, from the choices “dog,” “cat,” “hamster,” and “gold‐
fish,” with equal probability of each being chosen. Display the first few values of the
resultant variable, and count the number of each type of pet. [5]

> animals = sample(c("cat","dog","fish","hamesfer","gold Fish"),1000,replace = TRUE)
> animals[1:5]
[1] "dog"       "cat"       "gold Fish" "gold Fish" "fish"     
> fac = factor(animals)
> summary(fac)
      cat       dog      fish gold Fish  hamesfer

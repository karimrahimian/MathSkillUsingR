Question 5-1
What is the length of this list?
list(alpha = 1, list(beta = 2, gamma = 3, delta = 4), eta = NULL)


	The length of this list is 3
	
	
Question 5-2
Where might you find a pairlist being used?
	for function arguments. 
	Arguments function are the pair values with two part (name and value).

Question 5-3
Name as many ways as you can think of to create a subset of a data frame.
	t <- data.frame(
	     x = letters[1:5],
	     y = rnorm(5),
	     z = runif(5) > 0.5))
	     
	Using $ is good idea for select one columnor example for selecting x:
	t$x
	
	for select subset of on column  :
	t$x[2:3]
	
	
	another method is using indexing :
	t[2:3,3]
Question 5-4

How would you create a data frame where the column names werenâ€™t unique, valid
variable names?
	It is possible to add a number after the column names


Question 5-5
Which function would you use to append one data frame to another?	
	If they have a shared name, it is possible to use merge function
	cbind and rbind are two another important function to append one dataframe work to another.

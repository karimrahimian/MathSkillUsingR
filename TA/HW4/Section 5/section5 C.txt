Exercise 5-1
Create a list variable that contains all the square numbers in the range 0 to 9 in the
first element, in the range 10 to 19 in the second element, and so on, up to a final
element with square numbers in the range 90 to 99. Elements with no square num‐
bers should be included! [10]

	x =list(c(0:9)^2,
		c(10:19)^2,
		c(20:29)^2,
		c(30:39)^2,
		c(40:49)^2,
		c(50:59)^2,
		c(60:69)^2,
		c(70:79)^2,
		c(80:89)^2,
		c(90:99)^2
		)

Exercise 5-2
R ships with several built-in datasets, including the famous3 iris (flowers, not eyes)
data collected by Anderson and analyzed by Fisher in the 1930s. Type iris to see
the dataset. Create a new data frame that consists of the numeric columns of the
iris dataset, and calculate the means of its columns. [5]

	> irisData = iris
	> mean(irisData$Sepal.Length)
	[1] 5.843333
	> mean(irisData$Sepal.Width)
	[1] 3.057333
	> mean(irisData$Petal.Length)
	[1] 3.758
	> mean(irisData$Petal.Width)
	[1] 1.199333



Exercise 5-3
The beaver1 and beaver2 datasets contain body temperatures of two beavers. Add
a column named id to the beaver1 dataset, where the value is always 1. Similarly,
add an id column to beaver2, with value 2. Vertically concatenate the two data
frames and find the subset where either beaver is active. [10]

	> b1 = length(beaver1)
	> b1 = dim(beaver1)
	> b1 = dim(beaver1)[1]
	> v = rep.int(1,b1)
	> b2 = dim(beaver2)[1]
	> v1 = rep.int(1,b1)
	> v2 = rep.int(1,b2)
	> newb2 = cbind(v1,beaver1)
	> newb1 = cbind(v1,beaver1)
	> newb2 = cbind(v2,beaver2)
	> result = cbind(newb1,newb2)
	> colnames(newb1) <- colnames(newb2)  
	> result = rbind(newb1,newb2)
	index = which(result$activ==1)
	newresult = result [index,]
